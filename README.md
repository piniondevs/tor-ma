# Tor Ma
The repository for the Tor Ma bot made specifically for the [VANTORA](https://discord.gg/Q6q78thv) server.

## Contributing
If you want to add a command to the bot you can do it by adding a file in the `./commands` directory. The name of the file will be what the bot will register as a command.
If the file is called `hello.js` then the bot will be able to invoke the command like `~hello`. 

The file needs to export an object containing some metadata and a handler for the command. The content of the file can go as follows.
```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'hello', // This name will be shown in the help
  helpInfo: 'Just replies with hello there.', // This will be shown as the command info in help command
  handler: (message) => { // The actual function that will be called when the command is invoked  
    message.reply('Hello There ðŸ‘‹');
  }
}
```
